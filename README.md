# SQL-Projects
This repository contains my SQL projects, covering data querying, database management, optimization, and analysis. The projects range from basic queries to complex joins, stored procedures, and performance tuning. Follow along as I explore and apply SQL to real-world datasets. Feedback and collaboration are always welcome!
